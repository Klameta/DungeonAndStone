greetingText = '''Whether for glory, riches or martial prowess, you've decided to enter the deadly dungeon that is filled with both loot and monsters.

In order to come out alive you'll have to defeat monsters, collect the gold on them and purchase better equipment. You cant continue for forever as you only have 5 days to explore the dungeon before you're stuck here forever.
You have 4 actions per day - fight, rest, shop, do nothing.
When you attack, or are getting ambushed, first it's your ‚öîÔ∏è that gets dealt first, then the monster attacks, dealing their attack. The ‚ù§Ô∏è you lose equals their ‚öîÔ∏è minus your weapon's üõ°.Ô∏è
You can choose to rest once per day, healing 5 ‚ù§Ô∏è.
You can only visit the store once per day. Shopping gives you 5 random weapons.
There is no limit to how many times you can do nothing, but with each time the chances to get ambushed increase- it resets on a new day.

Each playthrough the monsters will be the same, but they will get more difficult as time goes on.

Good luck üçÄ''';
